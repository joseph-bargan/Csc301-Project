The goal for this sprint was to decide as a group the new scope of the project. User stories were re-evaluate and the scope
of the project was lowered to match the team capacity. The group recieved starter code for the porject from the instructor 
and the majority of the sprint was used to understand it. Major user stories completed during the sprint were:
1. Having a basic register page for the website which led to a post page but no functionality.
2. Integration of the database with JavaScript files but no connection with actual website or storing of user data.

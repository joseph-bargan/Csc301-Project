Communication response time:

We expect each group member to respond the message whithin the same day of receiving it.
If we decide to meet tomorrow, then each member is expected to reply to the message the
same day before the meeting.

Division of Work:

First seperate work into parts and we meet together to first choose what each one wants to do,
and then agree on how to do the unchoosed parts together.

Submitting:

Sally will make sure that everything needed is submitted and make sure that it is complete and correct.
At least one day before the deadline, we will meet at shcool and make sure that everyone know what work is
being submitted.


Contigency Planning:

If a member drop the course, Sally, Rui and Shidi will seperate his part and make sure to finish it on time.
They are not dropping this course and will finish everything left to be done.
If a member does not finish his/her part one time, we will meet at school and work together to make sure that
everyone takes time to work on the project.
If someone is academicly dishonest, we will report to the professor immediately as we notice.

IMPOIRTANT USER STORIES:
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8


User story 1: P=1

As a student, I would like to be able to see posts releated to only one specific category, 
so that I can quickly find the topic I am looking for.

{make sure to have categories for every area of student life, such as
departments, selling textbooks, new, questions etc.}

User sotry 2: P=1

As a student, I would like to be able to post a message amonymousy, so that I can post
a comment on a course/professor without being idtentified by others.

{This means that the username is not diplayed on the post.}

User story 3: P=2

As a student, I would like to be able to change my password, so that I feel more secure.

{If old password entered matches record, the new password is set and the old one is removed from database.}

User story 4: P=4

As a student, I would like to be able to search on the forum, so that I can look for a specific
kind of post I want (such as looking for a textbook or looking for a job).

{This means if a match of keywords occurs, only those posts are shown and not others.}
{If no post matches the user entered keywords, show "No match"}

User sotry 5: P=2

As a student/professor, I would like to be able to delete my post, so that if the information
on one post is no longer valid, I can remove it from the forum.

who has previously pinged this page should no longer be able to acess this post.}

User sotry 6: P=1

As a student/professor/staff, I would like to be able to leave a comment on a post, so that if I have
some opinion or information to share, I can do it.

{Comments number should be displayed on the post, and comments are initialy hiden, so that if a post hase too
many comments, it does not get all shown on the main page which means other posts are hidden down.}

User sotry 7: P=5

As a professor, I would like to be able to report a post, so that if the post's content is not appropriate
(academic integrity), the content gets deleted.

{This means that the post should have a "report" icon and a criteria needs to be define for deletion.}
{Need also to be able to detect any unsuitable characters or words so that post are not deleted for no reason.}

User sotry 8: P=3
 
As a student/professor, I would like to be able to see the newest post first, so that I do not waste time
on surfing for new content.

{The page should be refreshable, which means that each time the user login, the posts are displayed
according to the post time.}
 
User sotry 9: P=5
 
As a student/professor, I would like to be able to save/ping a post, so that I can look at it later.

{In the user's profile, the user should be able to have a list of saved list of post from most recent to
the oldest.}

User story 10: P=5

As a student, I would like to be able to return to the previous page, so that I dont have to refresh the app everytime
I want to see a new post.

is at currently.}

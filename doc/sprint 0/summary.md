For this project we are developing an android forum app where only students or faculty members 
from UofT can post messages. 
The key user stories for this project would be developing a discussion board which allows users to post messages, picturesn and also 
reply to other users' posts. 
The users names on the posts are anonymous and the users have the ability to change profile settings such as passwords.   
The forum also gives users the ability to have sub divisions based on departments like computer science, earth science, geopgraphy etc. 
where students in those fields and courses can communicate.

Objective:

We are developping an android forum app where only students and falculty members from University of Toronto 
are allow to register for an account and post messages on it.

The users need to sign up using their UofT webmail, and we will first pretend that we are verifying the email adresse.

Features:

- The app allows users to post messages and pictures where they can ask questions,
express comments sale textbooks etc. They can also leave a comment under other user's posts.

- The usernames on the posts are set to be anonymous so that the identity of the owner of a post stays unknown to other users.

- Users are also allowed to change their passwords.

- Forum will have sub categories/topics such as departments/majors (computer science, economic, statstic etc.) or 
general categories such as "textbook" for selling textbooks. This allows users to post 
under the relevent topic so they can communicate easier.

- We might also implement a search feature so that users can serch posts with a specific keyword from the entire forum.

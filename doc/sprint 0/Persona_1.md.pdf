Mike Scofield

Mike is a 20 year old UofT student from Hamilton who lives in a rented apartment near the campus. He returns home every chance he gets 
to visit his parents and his 14 year old sister. He is majoring in computer science and geography. Its his second year at the campus
and he does not know anyone in his programs because most of his friends from Hamilton went to McMaster University.  

He takes five courses per semester to fulfill his program requirements and works on the weekends to help pay for his weekly expenses. 
Most of his earnings are spent on rent and groceries, leaving him with very little money for hobbies. Mike loves playing games on his 
laptop which he saved up for months to be able to buy. Everyday after his daily responsibilities, he spends time playing games no matter 
how busy he is with school work. He also loves to work on personal projects such as developing apps for his resume. 

Due to his heavy course load and busy weekends he has no time to meet new people and hangout with them. Even during the winter break or 
reading week, he cannot stay on campus to socialize since he goes home to his family. This often causes him to work  alone for class 
projects and assignments. He wishes he could find a way to contact his classmates in his courses who also need partners or groups. 
There is no discussion board or group chat for his classes for him to communicate with regarding group formation or for help. Mike 
also enjoys playing his videos games with other people and wants to find people at the campus that also play the same games.
